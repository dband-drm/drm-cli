## What is drm-cli
The `drm-cli` is a Data Release Management system that seamlessly integrates with your current version control systems.\
This means you won't need to purchase any additional licenses beyond those you already have.

Each version control system typically includes basic tools for specific tasks, such as managing data releases (e.g., schema changes and data updates to your data storage systems).\
However, these tools are often limited, offering only fundamental operations like releasing data from a source to a specific target.

The `drm-cli` provides sophisticated management abilities that allow you to extend those basic operations.\
For instance:
- [x] Releases history save.
- [x] Detailed release flow status.
- [x] Multiple solutions releases under a single release.
- [x] Automated exception handling mechanism.
